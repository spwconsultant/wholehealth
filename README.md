Whole Health is a opensource EHR/EMR.  

Healthcare is expensive, and a closed EHR/EMR systems are not helping costs.  We think a business still can be built on an open source EHR/EMR. However, by having the system open sourced, bugs that can arise due to patient safety can quickly take care of by the community and commercial business that will built on this system.
