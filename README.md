Whole Health is a opensource EHR/EMR.  

Healthcare is expensive and a closed EHR/EMR systems are not helping costs.  We think a business still can be built on a open source EHR/EMR. However by having the system open sourced, bugs that can arise due to patient safety can be quickly take care of by the community and/or commerical business that will be build on this system.
